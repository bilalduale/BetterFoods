                <h2>Problem statement:</h2>

                <p>In 2022, Seattle experienced a large increase in food prices, with costs for home-prepared meals rising over 12% from the previous year, making Seattle one of the most expensive U.S. cities for groceries (Whitman, 2024). This sharp rise from the typical annual growth of 2% to 4% places a large burden on residents, especially low-income families, who are now struggling more than ever to afford groceries. The average household in the Seattle metro area now spends $289 per week on food prepared at home, significantly above the national average of $270. This positions Seattle as having the sixth-highest weekly food expenditure among major U.S. metropolitan areas (Brooks, 2024).<br /> <br />

                Additionally, the costs of dining out have surged even more dramatically, with price increases for meals away from home rising to 9.4% and 9.9% in 2022 and 2023, respectively (Whitman, 2024). These escalating costs disproportionately impact marginalized communities, exacerbating disparities in food access and economic stability. Notably, Black and Hispanic households are twice as likely to experience food insecurity, with rates ranging from 26.6-32.4%, compared to white households. A survey by the University of Washington discovered that 49% of low-income families in Washington experienced food insecurity in the past month. Moreover, 55% relied on food assistance programs to meet their nutritional needs (Stringer, 2023).<br /> <br />

                These rising food prices make it increasingly difficult for these groups to access nutritious food, creating a greater reliance on food banks.<br /> <br />

                The surge in food prices has severe consequences for the health and economic stability of the affected populations, compelling families to opt for cheaper, less nutritious options. For example, the University of Washington study also found that many respondents reported cutting back on healthy food such as produce and meat due to affordability issues (Stringer, 2023). This can lead to higher incidences of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and mental health disorders. These health issues not only affect physical health but also educational outcomes and economic mobility (National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, n.d.). <br /> <br />

                There are multiple factors contributing to the rise in food prices in the Seattle region. Increased wages are required to draw in and hold laborers in farms, processing, and distribution. This leads to higher overall costs of food production and supply. Additionally, rising fuel prices impact the cost of transporting food from producers to consumers, leading to an increase in retail prices for food. Moreover, disruptions in the supply chain, possibly from logistical challenges or global events, can result in food item shortages. This drives up prices due to increased demand and reduced supply. Higher costs in other areas of operation, such as maintenance of equipment and utilities also contribute to the rising food prices (Whitman, 2024). <br /> <br />

                Existing interventions like SNAP and WIC, alongside community efforts such as food banks and community gardens, attempt to address this issue. However, these programs struggle to keep pace with the rapidly rising food prices and the growing demand due to their limited capacity and resources. For example, SNAP benefits often fail to cover a full monthâ€™s worth of nutritious food, and food banks face persistent shortages, preventing access to fresh and nutritious food options. These programs typically focus on immediate relief rather than addressing the underlying causes of food insecurity, such as economic instability and systemic barriers to food access (Pathak, Richards, & Jarsulic, 2022). This highlights the need for more comprehensive, sustainable solutions to address food insecurity in Seattle, an issue aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" (United Nations, n.d.).<br /> <br /> </p>
